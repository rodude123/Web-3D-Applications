                <h3>Coca Cola</h3>
                <p>It was 1886, John Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, was inspired by simple curiosity. One afternoon, he stirred up a fragrant, caramel-coloured liquid and, when it was done, the mixture was combined with carbonated water and sampled by customers who all agreed - this new drink was something special!</p>
